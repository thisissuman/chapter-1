Q 1.	What is Emmet?
Emmet is a toolkit that helps developers to write down large code blocks in HTML in a few lines using emmet shortcuts. Emmet shortcuts help us in writing large HTML code blocks in a few seconds by just writing a few lines of code. Emmet can be used to expand CSS rules in HTML.
Q 2.	What is Library and Framework?
•	They key difference between library and framework is the inversion of control
•	In framework the flow is already defined, where the framework is in charge of control, we just have to fill up the skeleton provided by the framework.
•	In Library we are in charge of control. We can put and modify as per our convenient.
•	There are can be libraries in framework, but vice versa is not possible. 

Q 3.	What is CDN ? how doesit work ?
A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are. Data centers across the globe use caching, a process that temporarily stores copies of files, so that you can access internet content from a web-enabled device or browser more quickly through a server near you. CDNs cache content like web pages, images, and video in proxy servers near to your physical location. This allows you to do things like watch a movie, download software, check your bank balance, post on social media, or make purchases, without having to wait for content to load.
Q 4.	Why React called react ?
React is called "React" because of its core feature, which is its ability to "react" or respond dynamically to changes in data. React was originally created by Facebook in 2011 for use in their own web applications, and it was released as an open-source project in 2013.
Q 5.	What is crossorigin ?
Crossorigin is an attribute that can be added to a script tag in HTML to specify the origin of the script, which determines where the script can be loaded from.

The crossorigin attribute is used to enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for scripts. CORS is a mechanism that allows web pages to request resources from a different domain than the one the page was loaded from. This is useful when a web page needs to access resources, such as APIs or scripts, that are hosted on a different domain.
Q 6.	What is the difference between the React and ReactDOM
React is a library for building UI components and managing their state and lifecycle, while ReactDOM is a library that interfaces with the actual DOM and renders React components to it.
React provides a virtual DOM, while ReactDOM provides the actual DOM.
React is concerned with the components' state and lifecycle, while ReactDOM is concerned with rendering and updating the DOM.

Q 7.	What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js is the development version of the React library, which is not minified or optimized for production use. It includes warnings and debug statements that are useful for development and testing purposes, but it is not intended for use in production environments. 

On the other hand, react.production.js is the production version of the React library, which is minified and optimized for production use. It does not include any warnings or debug statements, and it is designed to provide the best possible performance in a production environment. This file is typically used in live environments, where performance and load times are critical.

Q 8.	What is async and defer.
async
The async attribute specifies that the script should be executed asynchronously.
This means that the script will download in parallel to HTML parsing and execution, and execute as soon as it is available.
async scripts do not block the parsing of HTML.
defer
The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed after the entire HTML document has been parsed.
defer scripts wait for the HTML parsing to finish, and then execute in the order they appeared in the HTML.
defer scripts block the rendering of HTML, but not HTML parsing.
